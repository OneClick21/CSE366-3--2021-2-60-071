# Report

 * Here we made some small changes in the `Agent class`.
    - we add a battery section for the power consumption calcultion.
    - we calculate the movement power consumption for the robot using `battery_manager` function.
    
* We also make some changes in the `visualize_grid_and_path` function.
    - Add label for every steps in the grid.

**We implement both A* and UCS in the same file**
